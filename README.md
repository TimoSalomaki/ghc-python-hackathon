Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Hackathon focusing on Python developers. During this one day experience, you'll go from the very basics to very advanced topics. There are three challenges but don't stress about the timing, not everyone will be able to finish everything in time. And that's perfectly fine! As long as you challenge yourself, learn new things and enjoy the process, we'll consider it a win!

Here are the challenges **in the order of execution**:

## Challenge 1
These challenges focus on writing efficient Python code by optimizing memory usage and CPU performance. You'll start with basic tasks that highlight common inefficiencies and progressively tackle more advanced optimization techniques. The goal is to develop high-performing code while leveraging GitHub Copilot to assist in detecting issues, refactoring, and implementing more advanced functionality.

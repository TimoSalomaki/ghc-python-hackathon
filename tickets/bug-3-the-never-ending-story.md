# Bug report: The Never-Ending Story of HTTPie  
   
## Description  
Hey there, lovely tech wizards! 🧙‍♂️ So, I'm trying to use this HTTPie thing to get some data from the magical land of https://httpbin.org/json. I was super excited, but when I ran the command, it felt like I was waiting for my Hogwarts letter all over again. You know, FOREVER. 🕰️ I could've finished a whole season of my favorite show and it still wouldn't have loaded.   
  
## Steps to reproduce  
1. Open your terminal (abracadabra! ✨).  
2. Type `http https://httpbin.org/json` and hit enter.  
3. Watch as time slows down and you age a thousand years waiting for a response.  
   
## Actual result  
Time dilation. Eternal waiting. 🧓 It's like the command went on a world tour and forgot to come back. I think I saw a tumbleweed roll by my screen.  
   
## Expected result  
A snappy response with some JSON magic that appears faster than a cheetah on roller skates. 🛼🐆  
   
## Environment  
- **HTTPie version:** do I seem like someone who knows how to check that?
- **OS:** macOS Catalina (I think? It’s the one with the beach wallpaper 🏖️)  
- **Terminal:** The black box thingy with white letters (default Terminal app)  
- **Internet connection:** 🦄 Unicorn-powered fiber (super fast)

**Tara Teammate:** Wow, what a brainteaser. To be honest, the bug report was a bit corny but I managed to narrow the problem down to how JSON output is handled. If I just had access to GitHub Copilot I could ask something along the lines: `@workspace Where is JSON output handled?` From there, I could keep using the tool to let it explain what's happening in the code and then even fixing the problem(s)!
